thundercats ! ! i loved it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in ! it will bring my youth back ! get your hand off the clanger ! is nothing sacred make a movie version of the banana split ! what about keanu reef and richard gere in a remake of the wooden top or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse ! but then again it could be better than the original series could it it always nice to see these old toon re released but after the abysmal thunderbird movie and the song ! i think i been completely put off just leave these classic alone a good memory i think remake are a good idea a the world move on people tend to look more and more into the past to thing that make them feel safe i believe this is the whole reason retro ha become so popular a long a a remake doe justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of person to enjoy and revive and old series personally i like to see cartoon such a transformer thundercats and m a s k get full hollywood remake leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memory of in the first place the thunderbird film wa apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson love to see transformer with real actor and cgi and make it at least a rating part of the reason for the success of such classic a the magic roundabout wa that the character were not the sweet and cuddly creature that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the picture of the animation for the new film show that these characteristic have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that ! film of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place i have fond memory of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film it got all the right material for an american blockbuster no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two it all very well and good remaking these classic tv show and film with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the original they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these show such a thunderbird and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it doe pose the question though that with all the long line of remake being made are film maker running out of original idea all i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kid show ever i recently re watched some episode and realised that there wa a level of humour shown in danger mouse that wa completely lost on me when i wa a child there wa a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of year back again like so many of these nostalgia programme the animation this time computer created flat cell like animation failed to match the original cut out paper technique for inventiveness and wa woefully inadequate we live in a sampling world the music industry ha been pludering past decade for inspiration clipping sound from year ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now it just cheaper to take idea from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new it got to be mr benn the story line about a man who change in a fancy dress shop step into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing ! if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it wa a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if it going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirate of the caribbean character muffin the mule perhaps after all granny and grandpa go to the cinema a well you know !

! very scandinavian rainbow ! i believe that childrens classic should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout doe not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among child because it original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the child of today a it did all those many year ago how about classic like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bod oh the list could go on and on !

i do care ! till then i have to make do with the citreon c advert i luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voice it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb child programme could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torch hmmmmm i could go on and on danger mouse at im showing my age noggin the nog wa one of the best child program the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no one could approach oliver postgate wonderful voice so in general leave well alone the original are good because they are of their time and the method used are an integral part of the story just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antic of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life like fingermouse bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and brick in the ultimate struggle to save the woman they love from the evil clown krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe car of course gerry anderson supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big screen big budget action it wa only that thunderbird the movie wa targetted a a childre movie that really let it down after all the child that remember those show with such affection are now the parent of child themselves it only because the people who were child when these programme were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhood is it i hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation i love that one in a shed clunkiness and you could recreate the magic perhaps if the remake were done in a look around you mock authentic style i might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be mega ! this re gurgitation of old film and tv show make me angry it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people idea because it guarantee to bring in the the same can be said of modern day pop band who release other people material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sell big buck in the short term the fact that they will be forgotten in month time is irrelevant e g starsky hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it ! i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies im only and do remember the series from when it wa on tv but have the set on dvd and it a classic the fact it so great come from the fact that there were very few special effect involved and compared to today stuff it look amateurish thats the appeal though it so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it',\n",

! ! best song in year you must be joking it good if you like that sort of thing but really ! listened to angel on radio this morning when i wa driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyric and tune perfection ! a usual the public have short memory when it come to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen song in the last year that deserve this award more it not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low im actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last year ! ! what about the special ghost town the buzzcocks ever fallen in love with someone happy monday kinky afro mcalmont butler yes joy division love will tear u apart angel is middle of the road rubbish angel is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap it musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result is very surprising though the brit ha a long history of celebrating rubbish music ! best of the last year maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it doe kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last year after all it alright for a pop song but the best song of the last year there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last year it a travesty rubbish ! who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio but i do recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the mass who would know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last year how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop wa on the way out where on earth did this dreadful list appear from while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear u apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last year should not include song le than year old a that would exclude song which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good show you got to be kidding angel is a great song but not the best song of the last year only the best song to be up for nomination at the brit i think angel is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i do think it the best song from the past year ! right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what wa will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song is that good ! im happy for robbie himself though ! best song in the last year what a joke ! think of all the great rock and pop song released in the and pretty much all of them are better than angel phil collins doe deserve award for all the good song he wrote angel is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artist who worked hard for there glory receive award so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me it proof that music and democracy just do mix still at least it wa will young oh it all just a bit of fun people take these award too seriously ! robbie ha million of loyal fan while even non fan know the word to angel him winning obviously reflects who vote in these award personally i wanted will young to win but that wa not really due to his musical talent ! i hate the song all it brings back is memory of school disco and no one to slow dance with ! i agree about angel i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song come on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio ha to be turned up to drown my voice out the song make me calm and serene and happy well done robbie i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angel is really that good a song it certainly is anywhere near a good a love will tear u apart by joy division or wuthering height by kate bush angel is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chamber it a song that will be played forever and bridge all age group robbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these award it is always artist from the past five year that seem to win the best of the best we forget about the late and early for example they were cool at the time but because they are cool again now show that the song have greater longevity than people think yes angel is the best song since the past year because it touch the soul a it carry a lot of meaning i always disliked angel intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre teen teen and middle aged woman to accept low quality low aspirational music a classic songwriting it orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who do particularly like music all that much folk without collection folk who have never engaged in that madness one experience when falling under the spell of pop music angel add nothing it is merely an irritating distraction a wasp that refuse to go away on a summer afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it you should feel ashamed of yourself you probably only know a dozen song or so do you so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hiss angel best song you are kidding right last five year i might be willing to accept but no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century no surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nomination list come from compiled by an eleven year old girl perhaps i mean will young come on what a load of crap best song in the last year i do think so ! ! what about all the real artist out there over the last year the list is endless but robbie williams doe even come close what a joke that song ha become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angel where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tell me the radio off why a half baked cheesy ditty like angel which ha become the anthem for million of romantic sop think how many time it wa sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past year is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musician may a well give up why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list wa very weak anyway but angel the best song of the last year ! ! ! ! i think not i did realize radio had so many listener under the age of ! ! people have such short memory ! a great song yes but the best of the last year not a chance i think the person a opposed to the song ha been voted for here the great british public at work again it a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted it not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smith in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone rose first album nope no because im not female and im not ! ok i like robbie and angel is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past year ! the shortlist wa great but him winning it is a joke ! predictable and laughable the success of angel at this year brit reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last year the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them a cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angel is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie repertoire never mind best song of the last year i am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding song music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list have radio listener even heard of joy division a band who through two album have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last year than robbie williams ever will no doubt about it there not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stance but angel ha hit home with a far larger audience than any other song it should have been joy division those guy have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angel remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in year from now the most influential artist will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrd the beatles and nick drake have done for music today yes ! ! i think it a brilliantly written song with different meaning to different people there were other great song in the category but somebody had to win ! robbie wa a deserved winner i am astounded that such a second rate record ha beaten such a line up of amazing song ! it a terrible song voted for by the mass who do have the brain to appreciate innovative and exciting music the best song of the past year really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down it just go to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose it confirmed one thing the british public are consistently dull lt no offence robbie but pleeease ! there must be a thousand better song than a formulated cheesy pop song for kid no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin ! i think robbie deserves it he ha been the most iconic of any star we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to million worldwide anybody who say he doe deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger wa queen but hey another one bite the dust ! ! obviously all the karaoke singer in the uk voted for it if this is the best song of the last year then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produce excellent material but this is not the best record a sad day for music it not the type of music i normally like but even a a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people that why it ha been voted best song of the last year it a good all rounder just like robbie best song in year since im confused angel is a bad song it a nice catchy formulaic anthem that tick all the box but this is not great music if anything it regressive bland even i suppose it just more evidence of how redundant the brit award have become granted angel is a good song however it really wa up against any other proper competition the queen song wa lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choice were pathetic ! also why were the stone there david bowie etc there are so many greater song than angel i wonder if it wa simply the fact that robbie wa getting more award so they had to make one up for him ! best song of the last year what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wa bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful angel is without doubt a great song but i really do think it deserves the title of best song in year perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song ! ! ! do get me wrong im not disputing his look but there are more deserved winner it would have been a travesty had angel not won without angel robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of it most charismatic and talented performing artist it ha to be seen performed live with people singing along to be fully appreciated well done rob i find it hard to believe that angel is the best we have to show for the past year ! im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at wedding and funeral because people think it ha deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic song but also making change doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popular i nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last the brit ha proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop mogul to boost band profile and record sale the same go with the scissor sister i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album come no where near u new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reason but for profit no surprise really it voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in music personally i find angel by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating song i have ever heard ! it absolutely deserved to win it is a song that ha united the generation and will continue to be played for many year to come it an absolute joke however most of the original were very poor choice a well all in all a pretty pointless exercise ! the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choice that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it did end up in the hand of will young though although it ha nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody know the word to bohemian rhapsody nothing compare u etc much better song and more timeless give it to someone with real talent although angel is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last year this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trouser if that all it mean !',\n",

       " 'brit debate over urban music joss stone a year old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the street to win best british urban act at the brit award her victory ha reignited the debate about what urban music is im not really comfortable with the word urban it a word that been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it wrong how far are the brit removed from inner city music and what people are doing it so far removed that i do expect them to get it bang on the music industry is championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people do feel like that anything to do with u i do feel like urban music just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brit acknowledging that there an urban music scene because it all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day it not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she look like and how she sound and who she signed to then so be it it got nothing to do with what really going on urban a a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core element that include hip hop r b garage and into that obviously come soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album wa called the soul session so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub genre and there are offshoot of all of those joss stone ha had amazing success in the u given that she a uk artist what ha really captured everybody imagination is that here you have a year old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tune and she look good i think that what done it the award for best british urban act wa voted for by viewer of mtv base i do think joss wa not a worthy winner she make soul music and that definitely come under the category of what we describe a urban the fact that she from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large city and she literally rural the great thing about urban music is that there a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think that where you can call it urban that where this new sub category or uber category ha come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experience of an older soul singer but you could argue that she wa being inauthentic with her emotion it is coming from somewhere genuine it ha to come across a real that the only cut off point we have here and that the only way by which we judge people what urban mean to u a an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think act from other ethnicity doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doe make a difference if everyone is included out of all the award dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other race received any sort of recognition or award a type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life she might not be urban but when did r b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now r b stand for rhythm and blue remember ! that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hip hop soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year it the street although dizzee rascal stake a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stone album are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that wa released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artist who were nominated or did win i cant see why people ca just congratulate her for the talent that she is she did deserve it but i agree with the comment about urban music it a stupid phrase and particularly british in the state they tend to use hip hop and r b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strange what in a name a rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term ance music is misleading because it doe describe everything you can dance to whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strike me a simply weird that joss stone ha won urban to me is what i hear being played in party in the inner city i live in brixton and have never heard the soul session pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any party i been to good luck to joss stone let celebrate her victory let also question why with artist so successful and talented a jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia key and outkast we did see a single black artist on stage collecting an award so what you saying is that any music that ha black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who is black and if it is then they should be acknowledged for it even if they pretty dam good at it she ha an amazing voice and won good on her oh but she not black well let make her feel real bad about it then how dare she ! though hang on did the so called public vote on this one this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what wa happening in the and in relation to what jazz wa the medium then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artist it would mean that blue would be put in the same mould a bebop cool and ragtime all very different style at that time jazz wa and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth it a lazy term to categorise music that you do really understand soul and garage are world apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connection if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of award won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents i demand a prize for rural music ! suck to the city it way better out here we have hay for one thing excluding her from what ha become known a urban music would be a bad a excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who make music which is le soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black too how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense i love joss to bit and do care what her branding is it amazing music full stop stop puting it all in bracket and let just call it music and let especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just set an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artist that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just a someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person wa good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to a country music or the artist for representing that style the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk ha developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo award the very term music of black origin ha confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music award it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music make people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore ha been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate a to what urban also mean perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strain of soul rnb and hip hop one which doe not also mean something else a we have done with crunk urban is just a word that come about recently to describe black music that become popular now the word wa even in use or common use five of six year ago it just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it im in a band that ha been called urban and i despise the label i hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because that all it is ever since the music channel and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these label have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcaster unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack a if it some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the label it is what it is just music a a black man i think i agree with some of the statement at least the statement made by the key executive black people should lead the music they invented we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she wa doing if she were black same thing with street amy winehouse etc who ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both time better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music award and i think mobos but why not brit so what if joss stone won the urban award her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the street had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else urban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting m stone talent but why did jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nomination are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comment on any topic these day more power to you people ! you have said it there is music you like and music you do like who care what label you put on it that entire category wa a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone it like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talent but i do think it wa very urban of her to sing angel with robbie williams urban is a nonsense term music of black origin well doe that include rock music made in the inner city well almost all band end up making music in london manchester etc and doe that make some weird implication that all black people live in city it doe make any sense why doe music have to be put into a genre it music you like it or you do simple a that i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music a far a im concerned we live in city and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shape what we write musically urban seems to be the new name for all style of black music why it needed a rebrand i do know a the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet a they a white rock band they wo be described a such joss stone ha a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music business and is best ignored yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though there only two kind of music good and bad',\n",

franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent example of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scot are good at and support our own good ! i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque should be looking for government subsidy i know that if i wa lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i wa in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship yes the government should fund music it brings joy to the mass there are already thousand of state funded musician out there sitting around twiddling their thumb on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use a long a the government wa funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idol type funding of music though a it would only serve to reinforce the stereotype that alex talked about only if the proposal make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amount of tax on their record sale if they had a government grant to get started they have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government ha better thing to spend it money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they a musician the government should fund music it should invest in music and those investment should be treated like any other investment i think the government need to provide facility and for young group and band to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the mean of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the condition for the talent to flourish and let it go from there i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record company !

it all well and good robert kilroy silk claiming that veritas is a party that doe believe in lie and spin but the truth of the matter is it completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the two horse race trend in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which ha just been used a a smoke screen for his anti islamism slur which got him sacked from the television i think that his view regarding immigration are shared by many it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue in addition a an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy silk opposing geoff hoon ! ! good to see the party of the right splintering in the way the party of the left have always done let hope kilroy silk ukip and the euro sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we a a country want to go not running away from it all mouth and trouser a clown trouble is any vote he collect may just end up helping new labour into a third term whatever kilroy silk and ukip do none of their anti european policy have any relevance outside middle england this new party might gain support from right wing england but will have little impact in wale or scotland hopefully this all this fighting within euro sceptic party will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political party which address more than one issue england need europe to survive and a soon a people realise this the better we ca rely on the usa forever ! at last an impetus for increasing the likely turn out for the election the electorate is disillusioned with british politics kilroy ha one agenda the uk and i be voting for him both ukip and rk s are representative of small mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind the interest of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people bickering that who in the overall scheme of thing really care about their petty tiff many people believe you kilroy you may even believe yourself but switching horse midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility the very idea of political party born out of such negative feeling a euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating one can only hope the public recognise these extremist for what they are and shun them at the poll i always thought that kilroy silk wa a self publicising egotist and this news doe absolutely nothing to alter my opinion brilliant about time this country had a plausible party ! having seen the recent bbc documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figure i can well understand why kilroy silk feel embarrassed to be associated with such people hopefully the ukip member who are interested in the political debate will support his action fantastic news pro european now have far le to worry about from the right the conservative are a confused a they have been since the mid and the extreme anti european are fracturing themselves into splinter group that split any vote they might get in local european and general election robert kilroy silk ego and vanity are his own and his supporter worst enemy a a euro enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy silk behaviour he took a party that wa just building up a head of steam and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup detat he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two the closer to straight down the middle the better a far a i am concerned but in any eventuality the two sceptic party will exhaust their energy fighting each other if every politician with ambition to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose we have ballot paper a mile long ! you got to hand it to kilroy silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self belief whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comment about the ukip leadership and like him i am also leaving ukip i believe countless opportunity have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really mean the eu comment last week about michael howard plan to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member state the sooner we leave this corrupt super state the better doe anyone else think that it is ironic that euro sceptic kilroy silk ha used a latin name for his new party rather than a good old british name is this indicative of the man contradictory vain and pompous i think mr kilroy silk ha got a very good point british politics ha become too pc and a a result ha no straight talking honest strong politician they are all interested in their own career and not the people who put them in power a a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped if mr kilroy silk life up to half his promise he will get my vote honestly who really care man with tan leaf party with no plan to set up party with no idea a one of kilroy silk east midland constituent i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him someone so keen on complete control wa bound to fall foul of ukip democratic nature kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not he tried to make it work but they did seem to want to grow up he wa left in the position of having to defend their gaffe to the medium this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy good luck to the man i say oh please ! this is an amusing irrelevance there is absolutely no chance of either of these party communicating a sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union future generation will thank him for his ridiculousness the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight what other politician can claim this i have a suspicion that he talk for a larger part of the electorate that his critic would like i shall be voting for him the electorate of the east midland voted not for kilroy silk but for the ukip kilroy silk wa made an mep because of his position on the ukip party list he ha no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament i would write off kilroy silk while he a clown and a one man band at the moment he a populist and that always dangerous the man clearly ha an enormous ego and looking at our current political master that seems to be one of the factor in success good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both party to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my country knight in shining armour he express view which are now more than common amongst society today but people are almost too scared to express them kilroy silk ha secured my vote and many more like me what more i look forward to the day when he claim victory wreck the eu and rescue my great nation without a hair out of place and his tan a perfect a ever ! great stuff the longer the uk dither over europe the richer we in ireland become a the only english speaking country fully committed to europe oh and send u over those hard working immigrant our economy need them this is just what the europhiles pray for a the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve it difference with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple party with the same view point just split the vote further thank goodness that kilroy silk ha gone now ukip at least ha a chance in the election ! it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining it proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroy silk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small party have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy silk it is a great shame this ha been dissipated in in fighting ukip ha a wide platform of policy not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy silk conveniently ignores in the comment surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrat nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volume veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy silk if he belief in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly member should resign and force a by election to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip wa good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow ! interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name ! every opinion poll point to an overwhelming anti europe feeling in this country kilroy silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with year of political experience we want quality school top hospital clean and efficient public transport punishment that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and le tax it need courage and honesty two quality sadly lacking in our politician kilroy silk may just have those very quality recruit the right colleague robert and your time may have come ! well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party it all flash and no real policy here let hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy silk slipping into obscurity veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too twee label of veritas symbolises that',\n",

    "article = \"\"\"Android Q isn't likely to debut anytime before the next I/O developer conference later in May. But before the formal announcement of the new Android iteration, a Google device with codename \"Coral\" has been spotted on Geekbench. The new device, which appears to be the successor to the existing Pixel 3 ₹ 57,419 models, is listed with a Qualcomm SoC that could be the Snapdragon 855, along with 6GB of RAM. There is also an explicit mentioning of Android Q - the next version after Android Pie.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the listing on the Geekbench website, as spotted by PhoneArena, the Google Coral device runs Android Q. There is also a section highlighting a Qualcomm SoC. This could be the top-of-the-line, Snapdragon 855 SoC with eight cores featuring a base frequency of 1.78GHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The device also has 6GB of RAM. Google was criticised for offering merely 4GB RAM on the existing Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL ₹ 69,825 handsets, while the competition majorly brought 6GB and 8GB RAM options. Therefore, a RAM with a capacity of 6GB would be fair enough for the successor to the Pixel 3 family.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Geekbench listing also shows that the mysterious Google device has received a single-core score of 3,296 and a multi-core score of 9,235. Notably, the benchmark results were published on January 24. This shows that these are too fresh to judge the authenticity of the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, the listed hardware is quite likely to be a part of the 2019 Pixel lineup that will run Android Q out-of-the-box - considering the history of Pixel devices. The new Android version could come with new notification gestures and have a list of privacy controls. A couple of recent reports also hinted at a system-wide dark mode and a dedicated desktop mode.\n",
